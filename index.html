                I was born in Dunedin, FL on June 10th, 1999. I lived in Florida for the first 8 years of my life then moved to Spartanburg, SC in 2008. I eventually moved back to Lakeland, FL in 2015 and graduated from George Jenkins Highschool in 2017.

                My first job was in retail while going through my senior year of highschool. Though I liked the job I quickly realized retail was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I tried going to college for about a year after graduating but decided a four year school was too much of a commitment if I wasnt even sure about what career path I wanted to take.

                Today I am currently enrolled in the UCF Coding Bootcamp in their fullstack web-development course while working part time. I am loving coding and creating websites and I'm ready to finish this course and finally start my career as a full stack web developer!
